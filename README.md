**the code is still in a private repo and ready to be made public soon**

Syndal aims to first be a beautiful feature complete tui rss aggregator. some of the features include support for html rendering and image rendering and the simplest ux possible.
The second part of the project is pushing the idea of syndication to its limit by providing utilities to syndicate any and all syndicatable website even those who dont support rss and atom feed or those that block the scraping of html on their website.
